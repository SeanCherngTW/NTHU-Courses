Well I am going to explain a kind of game that I used to play when I was 14 years old , it is called `` Jump your donkey `` The game starts with a simple rule , all the players have to pick a number up , the lowest number is the loser , this person has to be in a position where all the participants are able to jump him , the most interesting thing is that you have to jump from a normal distance , after that the distance has to be increased , the participant who is not able to jump loses , so he has to take the place .

Dear , for me before money ended , the lost time was very important for me , but now with age I see that time is going fast and non - stop , and now I try to have plenty of interest things to do , since I have my ( 4 ) four children I do a lot of things with them , but always things to help us live for future , it 's like if I do plan for the future and with them I reached stair by stair , and I explain to each why I do it with them , and sometimes they do n't like somethings but after my explanation they understand and it 's so funny to see in their eyes when you put down a foot in front of them often as they like something just because they see advantage for their life , the bigger lesson for me is when you teach something to somebody and people control a new situation , a transparent link before these people , it 's so powerful .
